* Emacs and Org

This is the source code of my personal website. It is written in =org-mode= and is hosted on [[https://pages.github.com/][Github pages]]. It uses the =org-publish= function to generate the static site you're reading right now.

For more information about =Emacs=, =org-mode= and its publishing feature:

If you're interested in the Emacs configuration needed to generate my website pages and the deployment workflow, refers to the [[file:minemacs.org::#blorg-section][/Blorg section/]].
