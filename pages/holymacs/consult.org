Consult is an awesome set of functions. More info on [[https://github.com/minad/consult][github]].

It's a fancy set of features and gives Emacs a more cool and "modern" UX.

Also, I found an issue when generating an Embark snapshot  from a standard Imenu completion: the results do not point to the location, but an error (/exit-minibuffer: No catch for tag: exit, nil/). I've tried =consult-imenu= and it seems working well with *embark* ðŸŽ‰

Let's install it!

As mentioned in the [[file:~/minasmazar.github.io/pages/holymacs.org::*Specs][*Holymacs Specs*]] we're going to also add some super bindings.

#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package consult
    :bind
    (("s-j" . consult-buffer)
     ("s-i" . consult-imenu-multi)
     ("s-l" . consult-history)
     ("s-I" . consult-outline)
     ("s-f" . consult-line)
     ("s-T" . consult-grep)))
#+end_src
